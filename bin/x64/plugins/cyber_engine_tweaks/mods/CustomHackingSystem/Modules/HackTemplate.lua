--TODO: Remake all tweakdb functions in redscript (this is going to be a pain)

--[[

	HackTemplate.lua - How to create a Hacking Minigame and it's programs ?
	you can check TweakDBUtils.lua (in the same folder) for all the functions used here

	What's is in this file ?
		- 2 fully custom programs 
		- 3 programs made by CDPR (Datamine_V1,Datamine_V2 and Datamine_V3 programs from Access Points)
		- 1 custom Hacking Minigame instance (that can host all of those programs) with different difficulties

	What do I need to do ?
		- Read. (or simply hover the functions if you have VSCode)

	--In order to create your own custom program, you need the following :
	-- UI (ProgramActionUI)
	-- The TweakDBID key for your redscript Script you want to trigger (ProgramAction)
	-- The Program (Daemon,hack,minigame objective or whatever you want to call it) you're playing with it's buffer size (Program)

	--Since we are running on custom and borked instances of the hack minigame,you need to create programs for already existing programs
	--This also means you can create completly different behaviors from "normal" programs using redscript
	--warning (and note too): these are separate and completly new,custom programs that ONLY work in the custom hacking system, they won't be intefering with anything else (like Access Points)

	--The order matters : first program you add here will be displayed on top, 2nd on 2nd row etc...
