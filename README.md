# Creating mods
This "tutorial/guide/wiki" requires you to read first the [Redscript](https://wiki.redmodding.org/redscript/) introduction page as well as the [CET](https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyber-engine-tweaks/) introduction page to get introduced to RED Modding and especially understand the basics and the syntax of redscript.
## Regular Hacks
### Lua
Lua is primarly used here in order to make TweakDB extensions (aka, your own minigame instance as well as the base for your programs).

You can check out [this file](bin/x64/plugins/cyber_engine_tweaks/mods/CustomHackingSystem/Modules/HackTemplate.lua) to get an example of setting up the TweakDBIDs for the redscript part.

Note : most of the functions 

You can also check out [all the available lua functions](https://github.com/ElysiumRL/CustomHackingSystem/blob/main/bin/x64/plugins/cyber_engine_tweaks/mods/CustomHackingSystem/Modules/TweakDBUtils.lua) if you want to see how they work

### Redscript
Redscript is the core of the tool. You will generally use redscript in order to :
  - Register your program actions to the system
  - Create the scripts for your programs
  - Run custom minigame instances
  
#### 1. Scriptable Program Actions
If you followed the Lua section, you should now have a TweakDBID that can be used in the system. Before using the TweakDBID, you will have to create a class that will be used as the base for future scripting.

Here is an example :

```swift
public class MyRedscriptProgramAction extends HackProgramAction
{
    //Called if you succeed the program
    protected func ExecuteProgramSuccess() -> Void
    {
        LogChannel(n"DEBUG","Success !");
    }
  
    //Called if you fail the program
    protected func ExecuteProgramFailure() -> Void
    {
        LogChannel(n"DEBUG","Failure !");
    }
}
```

The class have to extend `HackProgramAction` and contain at least those functions.
Once you finish the minigame, the system will automatically create and call the functions (succeed/failure) for each program in the minigame

Now that you have both the TweakDBID and the class containing the scripts, you can register the program into the system :

```swift
module MyModule.Template

import HackingExtensions.*
import HackingExtensions.Programs.*

@wrapMethod(PlayerPuppet)
protected cb func OnGameAttached() -> Bool 
{
    //Call the base method BEFORE adding your program, the system is initialized on PlayerPuppet too, doing this ensures that your program registration is done after the system's initialization
    wrappedMethod();
    
    let container: ref<ScriptableSystemsContainer> = GameInstance.GetScriptableSystemsContainer(this.GetGame());
    let hackingSystem: ref<CustomHackingSystem> = container.Get(n"HackingExtensions.CustomHackingSystem") as CustomHackingSystem;
    
    //Register the Program Action into the system
    //+ Register the class to call for the Program Action
    hackingSystem.AddProgramAction(t"MinigameProgramAction.MyProgramAction", new MyRedscriptProgramAction());
}
```
#### 2. Minigame Completion Events

The system also supports events when the minigame is completed (regardless of the program completions).

There are 2 type of events :
  - On Success
  > At least 1 program have been successfully completed
  
  - On Failure 
  > No programs have been completed or the minigame have been cancelled
  
In a somewhat similar way to the Scriptable Program Actions, you can create your own scripts :

```swift
module MyModule.Template

import HackingExtensions.*

public class OnMyCustomHackSucceeded extends OnCustomHackingSucceeded
{
    //Called when the minigame have been succeeded
    public func Execute() -> Void
    {
        LogChannel(n"DEBUG","Minigame succeeded");
    }
}

public class OnMyCustomHackFailed extends OnCustomHackingFailed
{
    //Called when the minigame have been failed
    public func Execute() -> Void
    {
        LogChannel(n"DEBUG","Minigame failed");
    }
}
```
However, the registration of those events are done at the same time you want to run a minigame instance

#### 3. Running Instances
You can run a minigame instance using this function :
```swift
//instanceName : Name of the Instance
//customMinigame : Minigame TweakBD path
//hackedTarget : Targeted object (Any IScriptable but generally any Persistent State or Devices) (optional)
//additionalData :Variant array if you want to pass on some extra variables to your programs (optional)
//onSucceed : Class called if the minigame is succeeded (optional)
//onFailed : Class called if the minigame is failed (optional)
//Return Value : Returns true if the minigame is launched successfully
public func StartNewHackInstance(
  instanceName:String,
  opt customMinigame:TweakDBID,
  opt hackedTarget:ref<IScriptable>,
  opt additionalData:array<Variant>,
  opt onSucceed:ref<OnCustomHackingSucceeded>,
  opt onFailed:ref<OnCustomHackingFailed>
) -> Bool
```

the simplest way to use this function is the following :
```swift
//this.gameInstance refers to a valid Game Instance (generally this.GetGame() from PlayerPuppet)
//this.hackedTarget refers to any IScriptable and is useful when you want to get the hacked target in your programs

let container: ref<ScriptableSystemsContainer> = GameInstance.GetScriptableSystemsContainer(this.gameInstance);
this.customSystem = container.Get(n"HackingExtensions.CustomHackingSystem") as CustomHackingSystem;

this.customSystem.StartNewHackInstance("New Hack Instance",t"CustomHackingSystemMinigame.MyMinigame",this.hackedTarget);
```

Here is an example of running a minigame instance when you press the primary button
```swift
module MyModule.Template

import HackingExtensions.*
import HackingExtensions.Programs.*

@addField(PlayerPuppet)
protected let m_CustomInputListener: ref<GlobalInputListener>;

@wrapMethod(PlayerPuppet)
protected cb func OnGameAttached() -> Bool 
{
    wrappedMethod();

    this.m_CustomInputListener = new GlobalInputListener();
    this.m_CustomInputListener.gameInstance = this.GetGame();
    this.m_CustomInputListener.hackedTarget = this;

    this.RegisterInputListener(this.m_CustomInputListener);
}

public class GlobalInputListener
{
    private let gameInstance: GameInstance;	
    private let hackingSystem:ref<CustomHackingSystem>;
    private let hackedTarget:ref<IScriptable>;
    
    protected cb func OnAction(action: ListenerAction, consumer: ListenerActionConsumer) -> Bool 
    {
      if (Equals(ListenerAction.GetName(action), n"Choice1") && ListenerAction.IsButtonJustReleased(action))
      {
          let container: ref<ScriptableSystemsContainer> = GameInstance.GetScriptableSystemsContainer(this.gameInstance);
          this.hackingSystem = container.Get(n"HackingExtensions.CustomHackingSystem") as CustomHackingSystem;
          
          this.hackingSystem.StartNewHackInstance("New Hack Instance",t"CustomHackingSystemMinigame.MyMinigame",this.hackedTarget);
      }
    }
}
```
#### 4. Instance Settings

The parameters sent as inputs in the `StartNewHackInstance` function are stored in a `CustomHackingProperties` variable. You can access it in the Scriptable Program Actions using `this.hackInstanceSettings`. On top of the arguments passed in the `StartNewHackInstance` You will also find :
 - hackAttempts (Int32)
 > the number of attempts (in a row) for a given hack. This number will be reset if the NetworkName changes. If you want to store the real amount of hack attempts (without resets) you should add a field to the targeted object's persistent state.
 - maximumHackAttempts (Int32)
 > Maximum amount of attempts (in a row) for a given hack. if the hackAttempts is equal or superior to this value, the hack won't start.

## Quickhacks

### Lua
#### 1. Basics
In order to get all of the available functions of the module in lua simply copy this line :
```lua
local Quickhack = GetMod("CustomHackingSystem")
 ```
Every functions are in (according to the line above) : `Quickhack.API`
#### 2. Custom Quickhack TweakDBID
In order to make the TweakDBID of the quickhack, you will (principally) need 4 things :
 - A Name
 - Quickhack Gameplay Category
 - Interaction (UI)
 - Cost
 - (Optional) Cooldown before usage
 - (Optional) Upload Time

Here is an example to create a quickhack
```lua
--UIIcon (returns "CustomUIIcon.*quickhackName*")
local templateIcon = Quickhack.API.CreateUIIcon("CommunicationCallOut","base\\gameplay\\gui\\common\\icons\\quickhacks_icons.inkatlas")
--Gameplay Category (returns "ActionCategories.*quickhackName*")
local templateCategory = Quickhack.API.CreateQuickhackGameplayCategory("QuickhackTemplate",forceBrakesIcon,LocKey(1234),LocKey(5555))
--Quickhack Base Cost (returns "DeviceAction.*quickhackName*_*BaseCost*")
local templateCost = Quickhack.API.CreateQuickhackMemoryStatModifier("QuickhackTemplate","BaseCost","Additive",4.00)
--UI Interaction (returns "CustomInteractions.*quickhackName*")
local templateInteraction = Quickhack.API.CreateInteractionUI("QuickhackTemplate",LocKey(1234),LocKey(5555),templateIcon)
--Quickhack (returns "DeviceAction.*quickhackName*")
local templateQuickhack = Quickhack.API.CreateQuickhack("QuickhackTemplate",templateCategory,templateInteraction,templateCost,11.00,0.75)
```
Note : the cost,cooldown & upload duration is reduced depending on the perks you obtained


### Redscript

Redscript part is relatively simple,for devices, all you have to do is :
 - Create your Device Action (your quickhack)
 - Setup the Action
 - Register the Action
 - Create the event for your quickhack


#### 1. Device Action
`Device Action` is a class that will be used to store all data needed for the quickhack as well as the TweakDBID of the quickhack (created in lua previously) :
```swift
public class QuickhackTemplateDevice extends ActionBool
{
    public final func SetProperties() -> Void
    {
        this.actionName = n"QuickhackTemplate";
        this.prop = DeviceActionPropertyFunctions.SetUpProperty_Bool(this.actionName, true, this.actionName, this.actionName);
    }
}
```
Note : you generally want to match `actionName` with `quickhackName`

#### 2. Setup the Action
You are going to need a `Device` and a `ScriptableDeviceComponentPS`, most of all the devices do inherit from these classes.

Here is an example on how to setup a DeviceAction using the `VehicleComponentPS` from the [VehicleSecurityRework](https://github.com/ElysiumRL/VehicleSecurityRework) mod 
```swift
//This function should be added in your device Persistent State
@addMethod(VehicleComponentPS)
private final const func ActionQuickhackTemplate() -> ref<QuickhackTemplateDevice>
{
    let action: ref<QuickhackTemplateDevice> = new QuickhackTemplateDevice();
    action.clearanceLevel = DefaultActionsParametersHolder.GetInteractiveClearance();
    action.SetUp(this);
    action.SetProperties();
    action.AddDeviceName(this.m_deviceName);

    //This part is not needed if the ObjectActionID passed is from the original game (i.e : NOT A CUSTOM ONE)
    let container: ref<ScriptableSystemsContainer> = GameInstance.GetScriptableSystemsContainer(this.GetGameInstance());
    let customHackSystem:ref<CustomHackingSystem> = container.Get(n"HackingExtensions.CustomHackingSystem") as CustomHackingSystem;
    customHackSystem.RegisterDeviceAction(action);
    
    action.SetObjectActionID(t"DeviceAction.MyCustomQuickhack");
    //action.SetObjectActionID(t"DeviceAction.MalfunctionClassHack");

    return action;
}
```
#### 3. Using the Device Action
In any `ScriptableDeviceComponentPS`, you can wrap (or replace depending on what you need) the `GetQuickHackActions` to add your own Quickhack (Device Action).

Here is an example still using `VehicleComponentPS`
```swift
@wrapMethod(VehicleComponentPS)
protected func GetQuickHackActions(out actions: array<ref<DeviceAction>>, context: GetActionsContext) -> Void
{
    let currentAction:ref<ScriptableDeviceAction>;
    let shouldDisableQuickhack:Bool = false;

    currentAction = this.ActionQuickhackTemplate();
    //You can also disable a quickhack if needed
    if shouldDisableQuickhack
    {
        currentAction.SetInactiveWithReason(false,"This quickhack is disabled ! (Don't forget the LocKeys here)");
    }
    //Add your quickhack into the actions array (very important)
    ArrayPush(actions,currentAction);
    
    //Don't forget the wrappedMethod() too
    wrappedMethod(actions,context);
}
```
#### 4. Scripting Events
Now that your quickhack is set up, you need to make some scripts for it (right?).
Still in any `ScriptableDeviceComponentPS`, you'll need to add an event for your quickhack using the Device Action class you created
```swift
@addMethod(VehicleComponentPS)
protected cb func OnActionQuickhackTemplateDevice(evt:ref<QuickhackTemplateDevice>) -> EntityNotificationType
{
    this.GetOwnerEntity().GetVehicleComponent().ExplodeVehicle(this.GetOwnerEntity());
    //You can also choose to send the event to to a DeviceComponent and/or to a GameObject by changing the return type
    //Most of the time, it is "not" needed and can be disregarded
    return EntityNotificationType.DoNotNotifyEntity;
    //return EntityNotificationType.SendThisEventToEntity;
    //return EntityNotificationType.SendPSChangedEventToEntity;
}
```

## Minigame Instances using Quickhacks

### Lua
When creating the TweakDB part of the quickhack, instead of using the `CreateQuickhack` function, use `CreateRemoteBreachQuickhack` instead. The steps are exactly the same as in the lua part of the Quickhack/Lua Section

### Redscript

If you want to launch a custom minigame instance with quickhacks (like the `RemoteBreach` quickhack), instead of using a `DeviceAction`,use the `CustomAccessBreach` class and follow the same steps from the Quickhack/Redscript section 

## Miscellaneous
A lot of the code (and in-depth) work was cut off from this "wiki/guide" to make it as "short and concise" as possible. If you want to know more about the tool itself don't hesitate to check the out source code (small warning : it's a bit of a spaghetti code).
You can also check out the [VehicleSecurityRework](https://github.com/ElysiumRL/VehicleSecurityRework) mod to see an example of the tool in a medium sized project.
